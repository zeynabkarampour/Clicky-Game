# Clicky-Game
This React application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicked on an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if user clicked the same image more than once. This project shows the use of React's components and rendering new states to the DOM on each lick.  Every time an image is clicked, the images shuffle themselves in a random order. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicked on an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
